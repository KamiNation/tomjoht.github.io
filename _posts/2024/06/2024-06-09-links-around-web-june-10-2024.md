## [Podcast] Mastering AI-enhanced Content Creation using RAG | Inside Tech Comm with Zohra Mutabanna | June 2023 | [LINK](https://www.insidetechcomm.show/1728253/15162890-s5e5-mastering-ai-enhanced-content-creation-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-with-manny-silva)

Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, can help AI tools generate more accurate, usable content. This podcast does a nice job explaining the approach while also acknowledging that the first AI-assisted draft is still a long way away from being publication ready. See my post [Gathering source material for context input](/ai/prompt-engineering-source-material-context.html) for more details.

## Everything You Need to Know About OpenAPI | Speakeasy API | May 16, 2024 | [LINK](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/post/openapi-reference-guide)

This is an excellent tutorial for developing an OpenAPI specification. In many ways, it supplants the [Step-by-step OpenAPI tutorial](/learnapidoc/openapi_tutorial.html) in my own API docs course. It will be interesting to see how AI transforms the coding and syntax wrangling with OpenAPI specification development. At the very least, this info could augment your AI chat as you use AI to help create each of these sections in your specification.

## Technical writing is not a dead-end job, it's a landing pad | passo.uno | May 29, 2024 | [LINK](https://passo.uno/posts/technical-writing-is-not-a-dead-end-job/)

There are a lot of Reddit posts from people wondering if tech writing is a dying field now that AI can do so much. I'm surprised and relieved that even using AI tools as much as possible, replacement of my tech writing role seems unlikely. I still have a seemingly endless number of tech writing bugs to tackle, and producing documentation is still a highly valuable role and skill.

## LavaCon 2024 to Focus on Content as a Business Asset | XML Press | May 30, 2024 | [LINK](https://xmlpress.net/2024/05/30/lavacon-2024/)

It's neat to see Lavacon take place in Portland this year. Last year it was in San Diego and before that in New Orleans. This conference has been consistent year over year, in part because Jack Molisani knows how to deliver a great conference experience.

## [Podcast] Pulse check on AI: May, 2024 | Scriptorium | May 2024 | [LINK](https://www.scriptorium.com/2024/05/pulse-check-on-ai-may-2024/)

This podcast pushes back against the AI hype, even dismissing AI as a tool for content creation. I think RAG techniques can overcome many of the hallucination issues, but I like the hosts' balanced and cautious perspective, especially noting the unresolved intellectual property issues.
