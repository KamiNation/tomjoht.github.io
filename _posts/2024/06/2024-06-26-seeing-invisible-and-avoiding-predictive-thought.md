description: "In this essay, I explore the idea of seeing the unseen aspects of things. I discuss several authors on this topic: Rob Walker, an art critic; Viktor Shklovsky, Russian formalist literary critic; and Robert Pirsig, author of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>. My main point is to avoid predictable, conditioned thought by pausing to ask questions about our experiences and the environment around us. In a world where prediction algorithms constantly direct us toward the most likely next word, pushing back and embracing creative ways of seeing and intepreting the world can inject new ideas and perspectives in ways that rejuvenate us."
