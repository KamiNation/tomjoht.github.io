description: "One of the advantages of recent Gen AI updates is the massive token input context. When you can pass in an entire set of documentation as an input, you have a much stronger possibility for powerful prompts. In these prompts, the reference docs can serve as a key source of truth. User guide content and drift out of date, but a freshly generated reference doc should be accurate to the code base, for the most part. From this source of truth, you can do all sorts of things, such as identify outdated content in the user guide, see what's new between outputs, get links in your release notes, and more. In this article, I share 8 quality control prompts you can use when passing in your entire reference docs."
