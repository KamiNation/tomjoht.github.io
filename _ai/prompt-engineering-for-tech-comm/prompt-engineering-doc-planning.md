the scenario:

- how do you know which bug to work on?
- scenario to avoid: crunchtime stress where you suddenly realize that a huge doc project is due in a few days, sending you into a world of pain and stress.
- 90 bugs in my queue. 
- look at releases coming up. releases are a great forcing function to do the needed doc work. first priority: documentation for the release.
- eisenhower triangle?
- doc work needs but not articulated in bugs
- many bugs to sort through. an incoming river of bugs. no time to regularly read them.
- your value comes when you align needed docs with partner needs. you want to be working on the thing that is highest priority for users
