In this chapter I want to articulate an idea that I've been thinking about for sometime. I'm not sure how this idea fits in with zen and being present and mindfulness, but it does. This idea is something that has changed me, including the way I feel about everything around me, more profoundly than anything else. I'll try my best to explain it.

The idea is this: Take time to look at familiar things in unfamiliar ways. It could be an experience, something said, your environment, your circumstance, a problem you're solving &mdash; any aspect of life. Instead of going with your immediate reaction and response, stop and ask a few questions about the situation or thought. The questions will prompt you to consider different ways to look at it. It's almost like a game.   

How can you see it in a new light? What questions could you ask about it? How might those questions cause you to see the thing in a new light? Stop and look differently, ask questions, become curious.

This shift in perspective aligns more with Rob Walker's *The Art of Noticing*. Maybe this is the practice of noticing what you didn't see before. Give attention to something, even as familiar as it is. When you look or consider the thing, ask questions. Do the questions prompt a different perspective? The goal, I guess, is to see the unfamiliar in a completely different light.

To play this game, you can start anywhere, but ask yourself three questions about the thing. Stopping to ask these questions might jolt you out of a familiar, conditioned response. Then once you're out of that almost robotic, conditioned response, you might start to see the thing in a new, unfamiliar way. Suddenly that which was familiar and known becomes unknown and new. It's a bit of a rush when this happens. Even the most mundane thing suddenly becomes something to wonder about. 

This shift in perspectives, which might be classified as mindfulness in the moment, might be the key to harmonious relationships with others, as well as other life hacks for shifting your psychology out of low moods. I'm a naturally curious person, and this technique makes me even more interested in the world around me. 

To give some basic examples, this morning I asked my wife if she's interested in cutting my hair (she's been cutting my hair for the past 25 years). I wanted to set up a chair in our bathroom to do it, but she said she wanted to cut my hair on the back patio. My initial reaction was that the back patio would be cold and wet, but instead of going with my first reaction here, I stopped and held the moment in my hand a bit. Why not go out on the back patio? Why not go to one of my wife's favorite spots in our house? In fact, she often spends hours just lying on the swing in our back porch. She's doing me a favor by cutting my hair. Why not let her choose the place she likes?

And by asking these simple questions in my mind, in the course of a minute, I was carrying the hair clippers out to the back porch, where I quickly realized was a nice place in the cool morning of what might be a semi-hot day. 

As another example, I was standing in line at a coffee shop this morning, your cliche Starbucks on a saturday morning while my daughter practices soccer at a nearby field. I was thinking back on the week and reflecting on a meeting I'd had that annoyed me, where a PM and lawyer indicated that some AI tools I'd grown to love might not be green lit for documentation usage. Instead of going with my initial, automatic reaction of sliding further down the rabbithole of grumpiness, I thought, what if I could no longer use AI at work? Maybe this switch back to manual-writing mode would let me truly see just how much AI was lifting my writing burden. Just how removing email and chat notifications from my phone allowed me to experience life differently, then restoring them, and removing them again allowed me to see their effects, this could be good. I might learn that AI isn't that much help at all.

In shifting out of this automated mode, I suddenly find myself in a new space, where answers are unknowns, and where I'm more curious than before. 

Surely these are mundane experiences, but we have them all day long. We operate in automated ways through so much of life. Part of the idea of mindfulness and presence is to stop and empty your mind of previous thought, or of all thought, and then to start noticing each and every little detail. In the Calm Meditation sessions, with eyes closed, the guide says to focus on your breathing rather than chasing various thoughts. Then she often instructs you to start at the top of your head and make your way down to your toes, listening to your body to identify feelings that you might have not been aware of previously.

In Walker's *The Art of Noticing*, many of the techniques are from artists who try to cast the unfamiliar in a new light to prompt you to see it differently. This new perspective on the unfamiliar shifts you into this same moment of mindfulness, where you see what you thought you knew in a suddenly new light and context.

The idea connects to larger philosophical and artistic movements often called "defamiliarization." The Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky was one of the earliest to articulate this concept. In his 1914 essay "The Resurrection of the Word," Shklovsky argues that one of the primary roles of art is to jolt us out of automated, habitual modes of perception and prompt us to see the familiar in an unfamiliar light. 

Shklovsky focuses in particular on how poetic language can disrupt our automatized perception of words:

> "The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects 'unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged."

In other words, by using language in unusual, surprising ways, poetry can "resurrect" the vividness of words that have become dulled through habitual use. The strangeness of the poetic language makes us slow down and consider the words anew.

While Shklovsky applies this concept mainly to language and literature, the underlying idea of shifting out of automatic perception into a mode of heightened awareness applies much more broadly. Experiencing the familiar as unfamiliar - whether it's an everyday phrase, object, environment or situation - opens up new ways of seeing and thinking. It's a jolt out of complacent acceptance of the status quo.

Shklovsky saw this "estrangement" or "defamiliarization" (*ostranenie* in Russian) as a key feature of art in general. Art makes the stone "stony" again by disrupting our habitual perception of it. In this way, art renews our perception of the world, giving us a fresh perspective on things we've come to take for granted. 

This lines up with the overall idea I'm exploring of shifting perspectives by making the familiar unfamiliar. By consciously disrupting our automatized perceptions, whether of language, objects, people or situations, we open up a space for new insights and experiences. Shklovsky provides a philosophical and artistic foundation for this practice of seeing anew.

Back when I was a churchgoer, this phenomenon struck me especially true with prayer. When people prayed in church meetings, they entered a discourse of common phrases and speech, such that if you'd heard enough prayers, you internalized the speech and could give a prayer on automatic. For example, suppose you were to give a prayer at the start of a meeting. You could stand up and without even thinking, just start rattling off the phrases and discourse you'd learned from the environment, without thinking much at all.

Every once in a while, a new person would give a prayer who hadn't been conditioned with the prayer discourse. It was fascinating to hear words that broke free from the common prayer discourse. The words felt authentic, genuinine, and interesting. 

So much is life. I see the same phenomenon with my children. Sometimes younger children will say things in deconditioned ways that ring true and genuinine. As they grow up, more of their language becomes phrases and thoughts conditioned by their environments. 

Surely an artist must try to break free from familiarization. When you do, you move past the layer of societal learning that coats your own own thoughts as a refracting lens.

As a technical writer, I wrote content in its own accepted discourse. I avoid adjectives and try to speak plainly. What's more applicable in the tech comm world is to see a product in a different light. If you've been experiencing the product through team meetings and other internal material, you'll be much more likely to see it as internal teams want you to see it. But users might have a completely different view, conditioned by their own company environments and use cases. They see your product in a much different light than you. The ability to step outside of your company's perspective and connect with another way of seeing is key to writing documentation.

Apart from any specific utility, though, I find defamiliarization simply engaging. I like seeing familiar things in new ways. It makes life more interesting.
