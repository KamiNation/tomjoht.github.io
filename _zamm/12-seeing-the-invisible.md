In this chapter I want to articulate an idea that I've been thinking about for some time. I'm not sure how this idea fits in with zen and being present and mindfulness, but it does. This idea is something that has changed me, including the way I feel, at times, about the things around me, more than almost anything else.

The idea is this: Pause and look at familiar things in unseen, unfamiliar ways. What you examine could be an experience, something said, your environment, your circumstance, a problem you're solving, something you see, or experience &mdash; any aspect of life. Instead of going with your immediate reaction and response, stop and ask a few questions about it. The questions will prompt you pause just enough to start seeing that which you thought you new in an unfamiliar light, sometimes as if seeing it for the first time.

In these situations, specifically try to find *three* questions you can ask. Hold the moment in your palm a bit and look at it from different angles, asking these three questions. When you do this, chances are you'll start to see the thing differently. When you see that new dimension forming, pursue it. Explore where that thought takes you. It might lead you down a new path. The journey down these new inquiry paths can be exhilerating.

## The Art of Noticing

This technique isn't new. It ties in with a larger movement of art and noticing, such as that articulated in Rob Walker's recent book *The Art of Noticing*. The basic idea is to notice what you didn't see before. Give attention to something, even as familiar as it is. When you look or consider the thing, ask questions. The questions will almost always prompt a different perspective. The goal is to see the unfamiliar in a new way.

Walker explains:

> Paying attention is a pretty vital skill for a designer. Then again, being what Saul Bellow called a "first-class noticer" &mdash; cultivating the ability to attend to what others overlook, experiencing "enchating reality" as a new and fortuitious gift &mdash; is crucial to *any* creative process. And when I say "creative process," I mean it as an idea that applies to a broad range of professions and pursuits. The scientist, the entrepreneur, the photographer, the coach: Each relies on the ability to notice that which previously seemed invisible to everybody else." (x-xi)

Noticing the invisible forces you to focus on the present, to look at the detail on something with more closely than before. One time I was sitting with my wife and kids at a nearby diner and started looking at the shell pattern design on the silverware. Surprisingly, this prompted a twenty-minute conversation into the symbology of the shell and the origins of the pattern, mostly driven by my wife. The small detail was something we'd never noticed before, but it didn't take long before that small detail become an object of intriguing curiosity. 

Walker continues:

> Anybody interested in thinking creatively seeks (needs) to notice what has been overlooked or ignored by others, to get beyond distractions and attend to the world. Every day, successful teachers, doctors, lawyers, small business owners, and middle managers pick up on the subtle clues and details that sail past everyone else. (xi)

Although artists occupy the most pages in Walker's book, he extends the same art of noticing to other professions too. Walker quotes Rob Forbes, Design Within Reach founder, who says,

> It's about observation and thinking... When you discover something special out there it's like stumbling into a cafe or shop that was not listed in a tourist guide &mdash; your experience of the world is much richer because you did it on your own. (14)

I agree that discovering the invisible detail on your own is much more satisfying than having it articulated by others. I'm not sure why, but it gives more autonomy and self-direction to the activity, and this makes it more pleasing.

Walker says, "Every day is filled with opportunities to be amazed, surprised, enthralled &mdash; to experience the enchanting everyday. To stay eager. To be, in a word, alive" (xvi). The word "alive" evokes a strong argument here. The opposite would be automation, unconsciousness, and a kind of death.

## Some mundane examples

To begin noticing, you can start anywhere, with anything. Be open to where the questions lead you. Stopping to ask these questions might jolt you out of a familiar, conditioned response. Then once you're out of that robotic, conditioned response, you might start to see the thing in an unfamiliar way. Suddenly that which was familiar and known becomes unknown and new. It's a bit of a rush when this happens. Even the most mundane thing suddenly becomes something to wonder about. 

This shift in perspectives, which might be classified as mindfulness or being present in the moment, could also be the key to harmonious relationships with others, as well as other a strategy for shifting your psychology out of low moods.

To give some basic examples, one morning I asked my wife if she would cut my hair (she's been cutting my hair for the past 25 years). I wanted to set up a chair in our bathroom to do it, but she said she wanted to cut my hair on the back patio. My initial reaction was that the back patio would be cold and wet, but instead of going with my first reaction here, I stopped and held the moment in my hand a bit. Why not go out on the back patio? Why was that patio one of my wife's favorite spots? In fact, she often spends hours just lying on the swing in our back porch. She's doing me a favor by cutting my hair. Why not let her choose the place?

And by asking these simple questions in my mind, in the course of a minute, I was carrying the hair clippers out to the back porch, which I quickly realized was a nice place in the cool morning of what would be a semi-hot day. 

As another example, I was standing in line at a coffee shop one morning, the standard Starbucks on a saturday morning while my daughter practiced soccer at a nearby field. I was thinking back on the week and reflecting on a meeting I'd had that annoyed me, where a product manager and lawyer indicated that some AI tools I'd grown to love might not be fully green lit for documentation usage at this point in time. Instead of going with my initial, automatic reaction of sliding further down the rabbithole of grumpiness, I thought, what if I could no longer use AI at work? Maybe this switch back to manual writing mode would let me truly see just how much AI was helping or hindering. I remembered how removing email and chat notifications from my phone allowed me to experience life differently; then restoring them, and removing them again, allowed me to see their effects. In the same way, this AI abstinence could be good. I might learn that AI isn't that much help at all, or maybe it's a huge help. Why was I so resistant or threatened by the policy in the first place?

In shifting out of this automated mode, mainly through a series of small questions, I suddenly found myself in a new space, where answers were unknown, and where the thing I thought I knew looked differently than before. My curiosity strengthened. This curiosity opened me up to new ideas and interpretations. I suddenly become aware that what I thought I knew might not be the case, or that some new perspective might also be valid and interesting.

These are mundane experiences, but we have them all day long. We operate in automated ways through so much of life. Part of the idea of mindfulness and presence is to stop and empty our mind of previous thought, or of all thought, and then to start noticing each and every little detail we didn't notice before. 

In meditation sessions, with eyes closed, meditation instructors often guide participants to focus on their breathing rather than chasing various thoughts. They might instruct you to start at the top of your head and make your way down to your toes, listening to your body to identify feelings that you might have not been aware of previously. In other words, they try to get you to notice what you haven't noticed before. To pay attention to the present moment and even the smallest, most subtle feelings that you might have been oblivious to.

## Shklovsky's "Resurrection of the word"

In doing a bit of researhc, I found that the ideas I've been describing connect to a larger philosophical movement often called *defamiliarization.* Russian literary critic Viktor Shklovsky, in the early 1900s, argued that one of the roles of art is to jolt us out of an automated, conditioned response and prompt us to see the familiar in an unfamiliar light. In his 1914 essay "Resurrecting the word," he focuses on language in particular. He says we often use words and phrases in automatic ways, without connecting more authentically and genuinely with meaning. It's the poet's job to cast new language that disrupts this conditioned response and lets us see the thing anew.

Shklovsky writes:

> The most ancient human poetic creation was the creation of words. Today, words are dead, and language resembles a graveyard, but newly-born words were alive and vivid. Every word is originally a trope. ... And often, when you get through to the lost, effaced image which was the original soure of the word, you find yourself struck by its beauty &mdash; the beauty which existed once, and is no more. (63-64)

Think of the first time someone invents a metaphor &mdash; the connection is fresh and interesting. It lights the imagination and makes language fun. But hundreds of years later, that same metaphor becomes a cliche, one that's said with almost no thought or understanding anymore. It becomes automated discourse that fails to evoke the initial delight in the language.

Shklovsky continues:

> Old works of verbal art experience the same fate as the word itself. They journey from poetry to prose. They stop being seen and begin being recognized. Classic works have become covered with the glass armor of familiarity &mdash; we remember them too well, we've heard them as children, we've read them in books, we've quoted them in passing, and now we have calluses on our souls &mdash; we no longer experience them. (67)

These phrases and ways of seeing become too familiar to prompt the initial reflection they once did.

> The broad masses are content with marketplace art, but marketplace art shows the death of art. (69)
> ...
> Nowadays, old art has already died, new art has not yet been born, and things have died &mdash; we have lost our awareness of the world; we resemble a violinist who has ceased to feel the bow and strings; we have ceased being artists in everyday life, we do not love our houses and our clothes, and we easily part with life, for we do not feel life. Only the creation of new art forms can restore to man the experience of the world, can resurrect things and kill pessimism." (70)

Like Walker, Shklovsky equates the lack of feeling with not being alive. If we slip into familiarity and automated actions, we no longer connect with the experience or with meaning and life. We become dead. New artists can help resurrect the world by reinjecting a new experience of the world. 

> The paths of new art have only been lightly traced. Not theorists but artists will be the first to travel these paths. (72)

In other words, new art has the courage to go in lightly traveled directions. It takes the artist's vision to break from the familiar path and instead find their way. Their footprints will be among the first in this direction. Later, the theorists will follow those footprints, making the path into a more familiar rut; eventually the route will be paved. That new direction initially awakens our minds and prompts interpretation, processing, and sense-making. But as the route becomes familiar and paved, its travel becomes almost unconscious.

Back when I was a churchgoer, the phenomenon of language automation struck me especially true with prayer. When people prayed in church meetings, they entered a discourse of common phrases and speech, such that if you'd heard enough prayers, you internalized the speech and could give a prayer on automatic. For example, suppose you were to give a prayer at the start of a meeting. You could stand up and without even thinking, just start rattling off the phrases and discourse you'd learned from the environment, without thinking much at all. Then attribute the spontaneous parroting of prayer discourse to an inner spiritual guide.

Every once in a while, a new person would give a prayer who hadn't been conditioned with the prayer discourse. It was fascinating to hear words that broke free from the common prayer discourse. The words felt authentic, genuinine, and interesting. 

So much is life. I see the same phenomenon with my children. Sometimes younger children will say things in deconditioned ways that rings true and genuinine. As they grow up, more of their language becomes phrases and thoughts conditioned by their environments. 

Surely an artist must try to break free from familiarization. When you do, you move past the layer of societal learning that coats your own own thoughts as a refracting lens.

I'm not saying that I always strive to look at things in novel ways, or that maintaining this perspective throughout the day is sustainable. This is something I might do once or twice a day, almost done as a passing novelty to amuse me with some new thought. There is much to appreciate from automating a routine, especially exercise, and often times I'll look past many details while I'm listening to a podcast riding my bike, or working through documentation updates. Even so, I still pause to examine something with a new angle and lens.

## Shklovky's "Art as device"

In another essay, "Art as Device," Shklovsky argues similar themes. At this point in the argument, I want to discuss the relationship with AI. Shklovsky writes:

> Considering the laws of perception, we see that routine actions become automatic. All our skills retreat into the unconscious-automatic domain; you will agree with this if you remember the feeling you had when holding a quill in your hand for the first time or speaking a foreign language for the first time, and compare it to the feeling you have when doing it for the ten thousandth time. It is the automization process which explains the laws of our prosaic speech, its under-structured phrases and its half-pronounced words. This process ideally expressed in algebra, which replaces things with symbols. In quick practical speech, words are not spoken fully; only their initial sounds are registered by the mind....

He compares automation to algebra, where symbols act as shorthand for the real things, and then we think in this symbolic shorthand, overlooking the details of the thing. This algebraic thinking isn't a math-based perspective but more of an automated way of overlooking and quickly classifying and categorizing the familiar.

Shklovsky continues:

> The algebraic way of thinking takes in things by counting and spatializing them; we do not see them but recognize them by their inital features. A thing passes us as if packaged; we know of its existence by the space it takes up, but we only see its surface. Perceived in this way, the thing dries up, first in experience, and then its very making suffers; because of this perception, prosaic speech is not fully heard... and therefore not fully spoken.... 
> 
> Algebraizing, automatizing a thing, we save the greatest amount of perceptual effort: things are either given as a single feature, for instance, a number, or else they follow a formula of sorts without ever reaching consciosuness.

He then quotes from Tolstoy's diary in which Tolstoy describes how actions can become so automated they're immediately forgotten. Tolstoy says,

> I was dusting in the room; having come full circle; I approached the sofa and coult not remember if I had dusted it or not. I couldn't because these movements are routine and not conscious, and I felt I never could remember it. So if I had cleaned the sofa but forgotten it, that is if this was really unconscious, it is as if this never happened. If somebody had watched consciously, reconstruction would have been possible. But if nobody watched, if nobody watched consciously, it is as if this life had never been" (Tolstoy 354; diary entry, February 29, 1897).  (79-80)

We might not be dusting but going about life on automatic, not consciously seeing or interpreting or internalizing what we're doing or thinking.

Shklovsky says:

> "This is how life becomes nothing and disappears. Automatization eats things, clothes, furniture, your wife and the fear of war. ...
> ... 
> And so, what we call art exists in order to give back the sensation of life, in order to make us feel things, in order to make the stone stony. The goal of art is to create the sensation of seeing, and not merely recognizing, things; the device of art is the "*ostranenie*" of things and the complication of the form, which increases the duration and complexity of perception, as the process of perception is its own end in art and must be prolonged. Art is the means to live through the making of a thing; what has been made does not matter in art." (80)

The artist enables us to see, not just recognize, the things around us. The artist changes how we see the world, jolting us out of familiar, conditioned responses to instead consider the familiar in a new light.

A translator's footnote says that the word *ostranie* refers to a poet's observation that "the making matters, and not what has been made; what has been made are but wood shavings." This reminds me of a recent podcast I heard ([This Week in Tech, episode 978](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/978)), in which the hosts discuss AI tools that make music for you based on text prompts. The hosts say that these tools focus on the output, not on the process of making. But the purpose of making music is to *make music*, they say. ("You can get the output, but what you really want with music is to play music right to the process of making." )Similarly, the purpose of writing isn't to have a written artifact &mdash; it's to write, to make sense and organize your thoughts and interpret and illuminate, etc. If AI writes for you, you bypass that process of making; you lose "the means to live through the making of a thing," as Shklovsky says. The AI artifacts are meaningless because "what has been made does not matter in art."

Shklovsky's essay might have been written a hundred years ago, but his argument is particularly resonant in the age of generative AI (GenAI). If you write with GenAI, you're literally using a machine that works by predicting the next most likely word in the sentence. This is the opposite of the process of making art. If you operate by writing what an AI model's training anticipates to be the next most likely word, you're falling into the zombie-like state of simply parroting back the discourse and ideas that society has conditioned you. You restate perspectives that are the most likely ones to think, given your cultural and societal learning. Instead of seeing something in a new way, GenAI teaches you to see it in the most expected, predictable way. This why creative essays written with GenAI often fail to connect with the audience &mdash; this predictive mode is the antithesis of the artist's vision. Instead of seeing the invisible unseen, AI leads you to see the most predictable and cliche.

Instead of taking the next step in a prediction machine, the artist (or philosopher or writer) must puncture the layers of social and environmental conditioning to see a thing in a unique way, to cause us to view that which we take for granted in a new, unfamiliar way. As a writer, you need to connect with your inner thinking self (casting aside the layers of social learning) as you formulate words. You cast aside expectations of thought and plot to make your own brush strokes and other unique patterns.

However, if AI can help you see the unfamiliar in a new light, it can be helpful. For example, when I started writing this article, I wanted to connect my initial ideas to larger ideas of thought and philosophies, and AI pointed me to the Shklovsky essays. I wouldn't normally read Russian literay formalist theory from a hundred years ago, but once pointed in this direction, Shklovsky's essays expanded my thinking.

AI also pointed me to the works of Edmund Husserl, an Austrian-German philosopher whose ideas of phenomenology (the study of how we experience the world around us) included a technique called ["epoché"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/#PheEpo). This is a method for peeling back the social-cultural lenses on experience to get to a more raw sense of our own interior. As I listened to more Husserl's ideas, the more I realized how deep the conversation is here. Philosophers have been trying to separate subject from object from Plato forward. Husserl isn't trying to get a raw understanding of external objects but rather use the subject's experience to map the subject's interior (I think). I don't have the patience to go deep in reading Husserl, but seeing how these ideas connect in other domains is interesting.

When AI is used as a research tool, it can help you see things in different ways as well. AI can point you to larger themes, philosophies, and idea movements related to the topics you're writing about. But when AI then does the writing itself, it can lead to an abdication of the process of making and to a loss of meaning. Without this sense of meaning in the activity, we will cease to write, make music, or art. The focus on the artifact/output alone removes the making process; without that process of making, the activity loses meaning and appeal.

## Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

Let's look at one more facet of this idea (seeing the invisible). This final facet will explain the need to unsee, or rather to see past assumptions and previous training or rationalist thinking, as you problem solve. 

In *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, the narrator explains the idea of stuckness in troubleshooting a "stuck screw." A stuck screw is one whose heads have been stripped, rendering a screwdriver useless in removing it. There aren't good instructions for removing a stuck screw. The narrator says that in troubleshooting, you have to clear your mind; you have to get rid of the assumptions that might be causing you to see the world in the same ruts and paths that might be the reason you're not seeing the solution. The reality we see is a *selection of facts* &mdash; there might be many filtered-out facts we're not seeing or considering because of the societal filters in our minds. 

The narrator says that in our approaches to problem-solving, there comes a point where rational, known understanding doesn't contain the answer. Instead, we have to let "Quality" guide us to the answer. Quality is a kind of intuition or natural direction. The narrator explains:

> To put it in more concrete terms: If you want to build a factory, or fix a motorcycle, or set a nation right without getting stuck, then classical, structured, dualistic subject-object knowledge, although necessary, isn't enough. You have to have some feeling for the quality of the work. You have to have a sense of what's good. That is what carries you forward. This sense isn't just something you're born with, although you are born with it. It's also something you can develop. It's not just "intuition," not just unexplainable "skill" or "talent." It's the direct result of contact with basic reality, Quality, which dualistic reason has in the past tended to conceal. (284)

The discussion about Quality occupies the thrust of the book and the narrator's preoccupation. He argues at length that defining Quality would subordinate it to rationalist thought and dissection, so he leaves it undefined. But the larger point is to remove the layer of rationalist thought that we usually rely upon and instead be guided by a more nebulous internal intuition and gumption (Quality). 

This idea ties in with the previous, as it connects with ways of seeing. Why can't we see the solution? The filters inculcated into our minds by society about how to think, interpret, and go about problems need to be cleared out. The ability to clear one's mind of all this baggage and begin to see things in a more raw form is key. This clearing of the mind allows us to behold the facts and details and facets of the problem that we may have overlooked previously.

The narrator elaborates:

> Now finally let's get back to that screw.
> 
> Let's consider a reevaluation of the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring, the zero of consciousness, isn't the worst of all possible situations, but the best possible situation you could be in. After all, it's exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to induce; through koans, deep breathing, sitting still and the like. Your mind is empty, you have a "hollow-flexible" attitude of "beginner's mind." You're right at the front end of the train of knowledge, at the track of reality itself. Consider, for a change, that this is a moment to be not feared but cultivated. If your mind is truly, profoundly stuck, then you may be much better off than when it was loaded with ideas.
> 
> The solution to the problem often at first seems unimportant or undesirable, but the state of stuckness allows it, in time, to assume its true importance. It seemed small because your previous rigid evaluation which led to the stuckness made it small.
> 
> But now consider the fact that no matter how hard you try to hang on to it, this stuckness is bound to disappear. Your mind will naturally and freely move toward a solution. Unless you are a real master at staying stuck you can't prevent this. The fear of stuckness is needless because the longer you stay stuck the more you see the Quality-reality that gets you unstuck every time. What's *really* been getting you stuck is the running from the stuckness through the cars of your train of knowledge looking for a solution that is out in front of the train.
> 
> Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation. (285-86)

Bringing the discussion back to AI, if we troubleshoot using prediction machines, the solutions we conceive of may be cliche, predictable, formulaic. They may be the obvious attempts from mediocre thinking. We end up putting our foot into the same set of footprints to trod the same worn path, leading to the same dead-end destinations.

For many tasks, this might be fine. Let's say you're not a developer, and you want a simple script to achieve some perfunctory task. There's no harm done in having AI create the most predictable, obvious solution. But if you're an expert in your field, looking to innovate, this kind of predictable thinking will only take you so far. You need to clear away assumptions so that you can, as Shklovsky says, trace new paths and be the first to travel them.
